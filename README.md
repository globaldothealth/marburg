# Marburg Case Data Equatorial Guinea outbreak 2023

This repository contains dated records of curated Marburg case data from the 2023 outbreak in Equatorial Guinea. Data are curated from openly accessible sources only.

Our latest data set and archives can be found [here](https://3mmuwilir3.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/web).

Our first line list was published on March 30th, 2023 and is based on data up to March 21st, 2023. As new data become available we are updating the line list. The line list is created directly from a report from the Guinea Ecuatorial Salud (https://guineasalud.org/).

There may be discrepancies and data remains limited at this stage of the outbreak. Should you find additional detail or have comments about the accuracy of information supplied here please address questions to info@global.health.

## Data curation
This section is an overview of the data curation process, a discussion about limitations and assumptions.

The Marburg Eq. Guinea line-list is built at this stage from data provided by the Ministerio de Sanidad y Bienestar Social de la República de Guinea Ecuatorial (https://guineasalud.org/). As we add additional sources we will list our sources in a separate file. The original source(s) of information is provided for each line-list ID in our database.

Users should refer to our [data dictionary](data_dictionary.yml) for a description of each variable. Assumptions for select variables are briefly discussed below.

**Case_status**: Only confirmed, probable, and suspected cases are logged at this time. We also list the number of contacts but no detail on these contacts is available. 

**Date_of_onset**: Information is  available for a selection of cases.

Data are hand-curated. The process and methods to create, organize, and maintain data have been applied with consistency. As stated above, line-list data may change due to ongoing data reconciliation and validation. We welcome your contributions and feedback.
